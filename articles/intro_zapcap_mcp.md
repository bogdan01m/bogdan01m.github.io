*How building a simple video app led me to create an MCP server that saves everyone the same headache*

---

Picture this: you're building a simple video processing application. Your users want something straightforward - just upload a video and add some nice captions with highlights, colors, keyword emphasis, and maybe some B-roll footage to [ZapCap](https://zapcap.ai/) (an AI-powered video editing platform that specializes in automated subtitle generation and video enhancement). It seems so easy to build, right?

It took me several days just to understand the concept behind ZapCap's API documentation: navigating their Postman collection, figuring out which parameters I should use to avoid ugly subtitles, then spending even more time learning how to handle those parameters to create something actually beautiful.

That's when it hit me: **If this is painful for me as a developer, imagine what content creators and teams go through every single day.**

- **Using ZapCap via API?** You're stuck with minimal configuration options, forced to use the same style over and over. Upload video, maybe specify a language for subs, and hope for the best.

- **Using the web UI?** Welcome to the endless cycle: upload → configure 20+ parameters → endless clicking until it looks "okay" → download → show your manager → hear "yeah, it's fine, not beautiful, but okay" → repeat.

## The "What If" Moment

One thought just wouldn't leave me alone:

**What if there was a way to just ask for what you want?**

"Process this video with professional subtitles and some B-roll"

Instead of wrestling with 30+ API parameters:

```json
{
  "templateId": "<string>",
  "autoApprove": false,
  "transcriptTaskId": "<string>",
  "language": "<string>",
  "renderOptions": {
    "subsOptions": {
      "emoji": "<boolean>",
      "emojiAnimation": "<boolean>",
      "emphasizeKeywords": "<boolean>",
      "animation": "<boolean>",
      "punctuation": "<boolean>",
      "displayWords": "<number>"
    },
    "styleOptions": {
      "top": "<number>",
      "fontUppercase": "<boolean>",
      "fontShadow": "m",
      "fontSize": "<number>",
      "fontWeight": "<number>",
      "fontColor": "<string>",
      "stroke": "s",
      "strokeColor": "<string>"
    },
    "highlightOptions": {
      "randomColourOne": "<string>",
      "randomColourTwo": "<string>",
      "randomColourThree": "<string>"
    }
  },
  "transcribeSettings": {
    "broll": {
      "brollPercent": "<number>",
      "customBrolls": [
        {
          "startTime": "<number>",
          "endTime": "<number>",
          "url": "<string>"
        }
        // ... and more parameters
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

I was already working with MCP servers daily. This protocol is a game changer for making complex APIs conversational. **ZapCap didn't have an official MCP server**, but why not build one myself?

The solution was obvious: **build a ZapCap MCP server that handles all this complexity behind simple conversation.**

## What is MCP shortly
For those unfamiliar, the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that enables AI applications to connect with external data sources and tools. 

Think of it as a universal translator between AI models and various services - whether that's databases, APIs, local files and prompts. Instead of building custom integrations for every tool, MCP provides a standardized way for AI assistants to interact with external systems.

## Building the Bridge

Creating the MCP server was everything the original API integration wasn't—straightforward and focused.

Instead of building yet another API wrapper, I focused on **translating intent into configuration**. When someone says "professional subtitles with green highlights," the server knows exactly which parameters to set.

The server handles:

- **File upload simplicity**: Just provide a file path (URLs supported but ZapCap can be finicky with them)
- **Parameter intelligence**: Sensible defaults for 90% of use cases
- **Progress monitoring**: Dedicated tool for checking task status
- **Configuration translation**: Natural language → proper API parameters

## What This Actually Solves

Remember those pain points from before?

**Using ZapCap via API?** You were stuck with minimal configuration options, forced to use the same style over and over.

**Using the web UI?** That endless cycle of upload → configure → click → download → manager feedback → repeat.

**Now:**
```
"Claude, process my_video.mp4 with template_id 123, 
green highlights, and bigger font size, add broll, plz"
```

**That's it.** The complexity is still there—ZapCap's API hasn't changed. But now it's hidden behind conversation instead of forcing you to learn yet another interface.

## What This Really Means

This isn't revolutionary technology. It's just **putting the complexity where it belongs**—handled by the system, not imposed on the user.

## How to Install

**Requirements:**
- uv
- ZapCap API key (includes $5 free credits after auth - enough to process ~50 short videos for testing)
- Docker (optional, if you like containers)

The setup takes under 5 minutes with two installation options:

### Option 1: Direct Installation (Recommended)

1. **Get your ZapCap API key**: Sign up at [zapcap.ai](https://zapcap.ai) and grab your key from the dashboard
2. **Add to your MCP client** (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) in `mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zapcap": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["zapcap-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "ZAPCAP_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Docker (If you prefer containers)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zapcap": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", 
        "--rm", 
        "--init",
        "-i",
        "--net=host",
        "-v", "/home/$USER:/host/home/$USER",
        "-e", "ZAPCAP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here",
        "bogdan01m/zapcap-mcp-server:latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "DOCKER_CLI_HINTS": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** The `-v` volume mount gives the container access to your home directory so you can upload video files from your local filesystem.

**That's it!** Restart your MCP client and start processing: *"Claude, help me process this video..."*

This works with any MCP-compatible client—Claude Desktop, Cursor, OpenWebUI, you name it.

## What's Coming Next

This MCP server is just the foundation. Over the next few weeks, I'll be publishing detailed guides on integrating this video processing capability into different frameworks:

- **Pydantic AI**: Building type-safe, automated video processing pipelines
- **LangChain**: Creating complex multi-step content creation workflows
- **OpenAI's Agents SDK**: Exploring agent-based video processing with OpenAI's latest framework
- **n8n**: No-code video processing automation for everyone (not just developers)

## Ready to Get Started?

The code is open source, the setup is simple, and you can skip the API documentation rabbit hole entirely.
